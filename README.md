## Predict Species from images
This project in the series is Na√Øve Bees: Predict Species from Images. We will build a model that can automatically detect honey bees and bumble bees in images.

Using Python image library Pillow to load and manipulate image data, we will also build a model to identify honey bees and bumble bees given an image of these insects.

This project is the second part of a series of projects that walk through working with image data, building classifiers using traditional techniques, and leveraging the power of deep learning for computer vision.
